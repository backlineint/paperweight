This repository contains the Drupal source for a work in progress Web relaunch of Paperweight Magazine.  The bulk of the work is contained in the paperweight_bootstrap sub-theme which is located in sites/all/themes/paperweight_bootstrap

paperweight_bootstrap is a Bootstrap Sub-theme implementing web presentations of Paperweight Magazine content.  Requires the Drupal Bootstrap 3 Theme https://drupal.org/project/bootstrap

This theme currently contains two re-usable templates - 'slide up with image' and 'interview with cover'.  An example of each can be seen on the Paperweight Magazine staging site:
