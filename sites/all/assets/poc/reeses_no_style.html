        <h4>It was fall of 1998, and I was in love. And not in the way that eight-year-olds fall in love with anyone who chases them on the playground.</h4>
		<h4>My love for Danny Rampersad was the real deal.</h4>
		<p>We just, like, connected, you know? We talked politics (Casey Miller's Draconian rule as class president must end!), sports (yes, I did think Mr. Celestin was the best gym teacher we'd ever had), and culture (the Laundromat level on Nintendo's Battletoads was objectively impossible). He told me of his dreams for fourth grade, and I regaled him with tales from my reign as "Scientist of the Week." We were probably going to get married.</p>
		<p>Halloween was less than a week away and Danny Rampersad had asked me to go trick-or-treating with him. Me! With Danny! Rampersad! My life was falling into place! And I was not going to waste this opportunity to make him mine forever.</p>
		<p>I was eight going on ten, so I knew what the fellas wanted. To win Danny Rampersad over, I needed a costume that said, "Hey, I'm an independent young woman with a taste for the finer things in life."  My choice, Food Network sensation Emeril Lagassi, was almost too good. </p>
		<p>Almost. </p>
		<p>The night finally came, and after slathering my eyebrows with black acrylic paint and duct taping a couch cushion to my stomach, I was ready. Armed with an empty pillow case (I was anticipating a big haul this year) and a bottle of BAM! Ranchero Seasoning Powder (I had a prop!), I was ready to win me my man. </p>
		<div class="row">
			<div class="col-md-12"><img src = "images/real_deal.png" />
		<p>Danny Rampersad and I traipsed through a crisp fall night lit only by the silver moon, suburban streetlights, and the flashlight that my Mom made me promise to carry and never turn off. He, a lizard with a bloody plastic ax, and I, a bulky man who got paid to eat in public: we were the picture of romance.</p>
		<p>Everything was going perfectly. Danny Rampersad had already remarked twice (twice!) on how fat my stomach looked, and I had secured a King Size Reese's and three Butterfingers-from the same house! I hadn't yet broken out my piece-de-resistance BAM! Ranchero Seasoning Powder, but I knew the time was fast approaching. At our next and final house, with a swift flick of the wrist and Emeril's signature exclamatory "BAM!" I would send a flurry of pepper and herbs into the night air, and through this opiate cloud of artificial seasoning, Danny Rampersad and I would fall in love, forever. </p>
		<p>This was, at least, the plan. </p>
		<p>But what happened next remains a blur of searing blindness and heartache. I flicked my wrist and let out my siren "BAM!" but I hadn't anticipated the headwinds! The Ranchero Seasoning flew back at me, my eyes filling with pepper and herbs. Dropping my sack of candy, I started crying. Hysterically. Tears of shame and pulverized oregano ran down my cheeks as I staggered through a haze. Losing my footing, I tripped and fell down a nearby hill, my couch cushion coming loose in the tumble. Wincing, eyes bloodshot, brows thick with paint and grass, I searched for Danny Rampersad. </p>
		<p>At the top of the hill, he stood, my ax-wielding lizard king, gaping at me with a look of disgust and embarrassment that said, "You've lost me forever, you sad, sad chef." </p>
		<p>I had come so close to solidifying our love, and in a single flick it was gone.</p>
		<p>The rest of the night has been browned out by selective memory. My mom picked us up and we drove Danny Rampersad home in silence. He broke my heart, moved to California at the end of the year, and I never heard from him again. </p>
		<p>I have since been in love, at times even more deeply than I was with Danny Rampersad. But sometimes, on crisp, well-lit autumn nights, when the air is cool and a fall breeze carries with it the sweet, sweet promise of ranch, I wonder about that fateful Halloween, and about Danny Rampersad, and if, at such times, Danny Rampersad ever thinks of the night when he let this tiny, rotund, Portuguese-American chef limp away.</p>
